# Online Checkout System -- Coding Challenge

* This is a JavaScript Supermarket Checkout Web Application written by Po Tin Mak.
* To run the JSON Api in your local environment, please download the repository and run python -m http.server inside your folder directort.
* The link to access the web application in your local environment could be reached at http://localhost:8000/store.html in your browser.
* Testing of this web application is done by Selenium IDE. The testing file .SIDE can be found in this repository as well.



# User Stories of using this app
* As a **user** running the application
* I can **add items to the basket**
* So I can **buy some items**
* As a **user** running the application
* I can **'checkout'** once I have finished adding items to the basket
* So that I can see **the total price of the basket**
* As a user running that application
* I can see the **price details of my order** once I have checked out
* So that **I can see how much I have spent and (potentially) saved**

# Follow-up Questions
* I spent like a couple hours on running the program by testing it on Selenium.
* I spent like three to four days completing this project. I started late and I knew that it is supposed to be
    completed like in a week, so that's why I had no time to make the app better.
    Because meeting deadline is crucial in software engineering.
* If I had more time I would definitely fix the promotions part in the application.
* I think fetching API and reformat them in proper places are the most difficult part in the project.
* I like the application, but I think if the task was given to a person who are just fresh grad
    then they may need more time, like more than a week.
* If I had more time, I definitely would make the application exceed the challenge's expectations.
